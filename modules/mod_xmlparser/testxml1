	What is this, in Catastrophe theory 
	An applet to experiment with catastrophes 
	The cusp and its properties
	This applet as a black box: how to interpret its behaviour ? 
	The cusp as a model for the applet behaviour 
	State variable, command space, potential, Maxwell or delay law, equilibrium manifold 
	Explore other cusp properties by means of the applet 
	Hysteresis 
	Divergence 
	Inaccessibility 
	Some other catastrophe machines for a more precise exploration of the stability notion 
	Zeeman's catastrophe machine 
	Zeeman's catastrophe machine as an applet 
	The gravitational catastrophe machine (JMT Thompson) 
	The gravitational catastrophe machine as an applet 
	Stability and perturbation 
	Perturbation of control parameters and structural stability 
	Perturbation of state variable and position stability 
	The seven elementary catastrophes
	Catastrophes in systems with only one state variable: 
	The fold 
	The cusp 
	The swallowtail 
	The butterfly
